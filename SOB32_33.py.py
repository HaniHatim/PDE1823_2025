# Online Video Game Store

'''
For my SOB 32 & 33, I have planned to design a surprise discount for the user between 5% and 20%.

To fulfill the requirements for the SOB, I have used the def functions to store my commands where I can
recall them at any point of the code for efficiency.

As for SOB 33, where I need to add an imported library, I have chosen random. My plan is to create
a program in which the user would receive a surprise discount to enhance customer experience.

###SOB 33: Describe how the interpreter/compiler 'imports'.###

In Python, the import statement allows us to use external modules and libraries in our code.
When we import a module, Python first checks if it is a built-in module, then searches for it in the systemâ€™s directories.
If found, it loads the module into memory, compiles it if necessary, and executes its code.
This allows us to access predefined functions and features without writing everything from scratch.
